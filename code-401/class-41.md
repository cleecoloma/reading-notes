# Class 41 Summary
## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development in Full-Stack JavaScript

### Getting Started with React Native
1. Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.
> 1. View: A fundamental UI building block, similar to a <div> in web development.
> 2. Text: Represents text content, comparable to the <span> element.
> 3. Image: Displays images, analogous to the <img> tag.
2. What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?
> React Native allows the development of mobile applications using JavaScript and React, enabling a single codebase for both iOS and Android platforms, hence the term `native`.
3. What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?
> React Native apps consist of components like View, Text, and Image, similar to React web apps, but the key difference lies in platform-specific components and modules used for features like navigation, gestures, and animations.

### Expo
1. What solution does expo provide?
> Expo provides a set of tools and services to simplify the development of React Native applications, offering features like a development environment, pre-built components, and easy deployment.
2. Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.
> Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the "developer-friendly" workflow.
3. What is the difference between React Native and Expo?
> React Native is the framework for building mobile apps using JavaScript and React, while Expo is a set of tools and services built on top of React Native to streamline development; using Expo means relying on its managed workflow, which abstracts away some configuration complexities.

### Expo Snack
1. Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?
> Snack allows you to develop and preview React Native applications directly in your web browser without the need for local setup or installations.

### Ejecting
1. What does `eject` mean within the context of Expo?
> `Eject` in the context of Expo refers to transitioning a project from Expo's managed workflow to the bare workflow, exposing more advanced configuration options.
2. When should you not eject?
> You should avoid ejecting from Expo's managed workflow if you prefer the simplicity and convenience provided by Expo's abstraction of certain development complexities.
3. Why might you choose to eject?
> You might choose to eject from Expo when you require more control over the configuration of your React Native project, access to native modules, or the ability to integrate with native code beyond what Expo's managed workflow allows.
