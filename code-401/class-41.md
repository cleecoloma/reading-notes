2. What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?
> React Native allows the development of mobile applications using JavaScript and React, enabling a single codebase for both iOS and Android platforms, hence the term `native`.
3. What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?
> React Native apps consist of components like View, Text, and Image, similar to React web apps, but the key difference lies in platform-specific components and modules used for features like navigation, gestures, and animations.

### Expo
1. What solution does expo provide?
> Expo provides a set of tools and services to simplify the development of React Native applications, offering features like a development environment, pre-built components, and easy deployment.
2. Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.
> Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the "developer-friendly" workflow.
3. What is the difference between React Native and Expo?
> React Native is the framework for building mobile apps using JavaScript and React, while Expo is a set of tools and services built on top of React Native to streamline development; using Expo means relying on its managed workflow, which abstracts away some configuration complexities.

### Expo Snack
1. Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?
> Snack allows you to develop and preview React Native applications directly in your web browser without the need for local setup or installations.
