### Redux Toolkit (RTK)
1. What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?
> Redux Toolkit addresses concerns like boilerplate code, complex setup, and performance optimizations in Redux development.
2. What does `configureStore()` do?
> `configureStore()` in Redux Toolkit simplifies the creation of a Redux store by providing sensible defaults and built-in middleware configuration.
3. How would I use `createSlice()`?
> To use `createSlice()`, you define a slice of your Redux state with reducers and actions in a concise manner, making it easy to manage a portion of the state.

### MobX
1. What is Mobx?
> MobX is a state management library for JavaScript applications that enables simple, reactive state management.
2. How does MobX make it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state?
> MobX ensures consistency by automatically tracking and updating dependent values whenever observed data changes, making it nearly impossible to have inconsistent states.
3. How would we build a reactive user interface?
> To build a reactive user interface with MobX, you mark state variables as observables and create reactions (like components) that automatically update when the observed data changes, leading to a responsive UI.
