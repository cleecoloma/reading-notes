> These topics relates because Role Based Access Control (RBAC) its a way for use to assign authorization roles to our applications.

### 5 steps to RBAC
1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?
> Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is a system that manages who can do what in a computer system. We care about it to ensure that only authorized people can access specific information or perform certain actions.
2. Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.
> In RBAC, you might have roles like "Admin," "Manager," and "Employee," each with different permissions. For example, an Admin role could have full access, a Manager role might have access to certain data, and an Employee role might have limited access.
3. What approach might you take to implement RBAC?
> To implement RBAC, you can start by identifying roles and their associated permissions, then assign these roles to users based on their job responsibilities. Regularly review and update these assignments to maintain security.

### wiki - RBAC
1. If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?
> Authorization, in contrast to authentication (proving who you are), is about determining what actions or resources a user or role is allowed to access.
2. Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.
> 1. Role Assignment - associating users with roles
> 2. Role Authorization - defining what each role can do
> 3. Role Management - administering and updating roles
3. Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.
> Imagine RBAC as a system where employees have different keys to access different rooms in an office building, ensuring that each person can only enter the rooms they need for their job.

### RBAC tutorial
1. What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.
> Access rights in RBAC are associated with roles, not individual users. Users are assigned roles, and those roles determine their access rights.
2. Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?
> Access rights (authorization) are activated after a user successfully logs in or authenticates.
3. Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.
> RBAC can benefit a business by improving security, simplifying user access management, reducing the risk of data breaches, and ensuring that employees only have access to the resources necessary for their roles, which can increase productivity and efficiency.
