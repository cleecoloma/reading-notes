### Choosing the State Structure
1. Summarize the five principles for structuring state.
  * ***Group related state:*** Combine state variables updated together into one.
  * **Avoid contradictions in state:** Prevent conflicting state information.
  * ***Avoid redundant state:*** Don't store data that can be calculated from props or existing state.
  * ***Avoid duplication in state:*** Reduce repeated data within state.
  * ***Avoid deeply nested state:*** Keep state hierarchy flat for easier updates.

1. What problem do Contexts aim to solve?
  > Passing props can become verbose and inconvenient when you need to pass some prop deeply through the tree, or if many components need the same prop. React's context feature allows to “teleport” data to the components in the tree that need it without passing props
2. What is one technique to try before useContext?
3. What hook complements useContext for complex applications?
