### Event Driven Programming
1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
> EventEmitter is a native Node.js module that allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming.
2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) enhances Event-Driven Programming (EDP) by providing a structured way to encapsulate event-related logic, manage state, and create reusable components, improving code organization and maintainability in event-driven systems. OOP's principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism can be leveraged to design modular event-handling components, making it easier to handle diverse event types and maintain clean, maintainable code.
3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
> Event Driven Programming in Node.js, like a hidden butler in a restaurant, helps handle tasks efficiently in the background. It's like having someone ready to respond when orders (events) come in, making your web applications responsive and scalable by efficiently managing tasks like handling requests, processing data, and sending responses.
