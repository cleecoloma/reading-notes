> These topics relates because it influences software application's maintainability, scalability, and predictability, offering effective control over mutable state and improving code quality, especially in complex or large projects.

### Extracting State Logic into a Reducer
1. What is the motivation for adding a reducer?
> The motivation for adding a reducer is to centralize and manage changes to state in a more predictable and maintainable way, especially in complex applications.
2. What are actions in the context of a reducer? How are they different than setting state directly?
> In the context of a reducer, actions are simple objects that describe what state changes need to occur, making it easier to track and handle state modifications compared to setting state directly.
3. What common list operation is useReduce named for, and why?
> useReduce is named for the common "reduce" operation in functional programming, as it's designed to accumulate and process a series of actions to update state in a structured manner.
4. When should you switch from useState to useReducer?
> You should switch from useState to useReducer when your component's state management becomes more complex and you need better control over state changes, or when you have multiple interdependent state variables that need to be updated together.
