> These topics relates because React is one of the most popular frameworks in the frontend side of web development.

### Read the React Quick Start quide, to refresh your memory on React.
1. What are the building blocks of a React app?
> React apps are made out of `components`.
2. What is the difference between an HTML element and a React component?
> React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.
3. What is JSX and why do we use it?
> JSX is a markup syntax. We use it because it is stricter than HTML.
4. Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.
> JSX lets you put markup into JavaScript. Curly braces let you “escape back” into JavaScript so that you can embed some variable from your code and display it to the user
5. Does React or JSX have any special features for iteration or conditional logic?
> There's no special syntax for writing conditional logic while `map()` is used for iteration.
6. How does React know to respond to a user’s inputs?
> React can respond to a user's inputs by using event handlers.
7. What word indicates that a React component manages data with a Hook?
> `use` - when a function starts with `use` word.
8. How can two react components share data?
> Two react components share data by passing `states` as `props`

### Render and Commit
1. What are the three steps of refreshing a React UI?
> 1. Triggering a render (delivering the guest’s order to the kitchen)
>
> 2. Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
>
> 3. Committing to the DOM (placing the order on the table)
2. How do you trigger updates to a component after the initial render?
> The component’s (or one of its ancestors’) state has been updated.
3. Does React recreate DOM nodes on every rerender?
> No, React is designed to efficiently update the DOM to reflect changes in your application's state without completely re-creating the entire DOM tree
4. After React has updated the DOM, what still needs to happen before the user sees the change?
> React commits changes to the DOM.

### Additional Questions
1. Note the naming conventions in the Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide. What pattern(s) do you see?
> Components starts with a capital letter
2. Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?
> I look forward to learning more about React Hooks as we have been using class components so far.
3. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
> I want to learn more about the inner workings  of React.
