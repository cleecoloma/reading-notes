# Class 09 Summary
## Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development

> These topics relates because functional programming is a big part in programming and I will utilize it on my future job.

### Functional Programming Concepts
1. What is functional programming?
> Functional programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structures and elements of computer programs - that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
> Pure function returns the same result if given the same arguments (also referred as deterministic) and this function does not cause any observable side effects.
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
> Some benefits are the following:
> * Determinism - no randomness or uncertainty involved.
> * Reproducibility - output match the expected results.
> * Modularity - they don't depend on external factors or mutable state. Thus, they are easier to use to create more complex functions.
4. What is immutability?
> Immutability refers to the property of an object or data structure that cannot be modified after it is created.
5. What is Referential transparency?
> Referential transparency refers to the property of an expression or function call where it can be replaced with its resulting value without affecting the program's behavior.

### Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()
1. What is a module?
> It's just another JavaScript file. It's a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates related functionality.
2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
> `require` allows developers to access files/functions outside to be utilized inside that file
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
> Utilize `require` at the top of the file and assign it to a variable.
4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
> We need to use `module.exports` in order the file to be utilized in a file that has `require` in it.

### Things I want to learn more about.
