### HTML Forms - Your First Web Form. How to Structure A Web Form
  1. Why are forms so important in web development?
    > Forms are important in web development because it allows us to collect data from users.
  2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?
    > Keep it simple and stay focused: ask only for the data you absolutely need.
    > Make buttons look like buttons.
    > Make required fields obvious
  3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.
    > 1. `<button>` - defines a clickable button.
    > 2. `<label` - defines a label for several form elements. It is useful for screen-reader users because the screen-reader will read the label out loud.
    > 3. `<input>` - is the most used from element. It can be displayed in several ways such as button, image, checkbox, etc.
    > 4. `<textarea>` - defines a multi-line input field (a text area). It has attributes such as `rows` and `cols` to define the size of the text area.
    > 5. `<legend>` - defines a caption for the `<fieldset>` element

### Learn JS - Introduction To Events
  1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
    > Events are something that makes web apps interactive such as clicking a button and an action will happen inside the web app.
  2. When using the `addEventListener()` method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
    > * The action we want to listen to such as "click" or "keydown".
    > * A function to call whe the action happens.
  3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
    > Event objects are passed inside the event handler function to provide extra features and information.
  4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
    > * Event bubbling is how the browser handles events targeted at nested elements.
    > * Event capturing works in the reverse order as event bubbling. The event fires first on the least nested element.
