### Ordered and Unordered lists
1. When should you use an `unordered list` in your HTML document?
  > YOu use it when the items does not need numerical ordering or order is meaningless.
2. How do you change the `bullet style` of unordered list items?
  > You can use the `type` attribute on the unordered list item tag to change the style.
3. When should you use an `ordered list` vs an `unorder list` in your HTML document?
  > You use an `ordered list` when you are creating a ordered/sequential information.
4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on `list items` provided by an `ordered list`?
  > You would change the numbers by using `type` attribute or using `reversed` attribute.

### The Box Model
1. Describe the CSS properties of `margin` and `padding` as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?
  > "The Box Model" is a story set in Webville, where Margin and Padding, two characters, maintain harmony in the town's layout. Margin creates space between elements, while Padding provides comfort and support. They collaborate to accommodate new elements, prevent chaos, and ensure visual order. Their unity brings balance to Webville's web design, resulting in a flourishing and organized landscape for visitors to enjoy.
  > Utilize ChatGPT to create this story.
2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the `box model`.
  > * Content
  > * Padding
  > * Border
  > * Margin

### Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops
1. What `data types` can you store inside of an `Array`?
  > Any data types
2. Is the `people` array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?
  > Yes, it is a valid JavaScript array. You can access the values stored in an array by using index number.
`const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];`
3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
4. Read the code below and evaluate the last `expression` and explain what the result would be and why.
  > `let a = 10;`
  > `let b = 'dog';`
  > `let c = false;`
  > `// evaluate this`
  > `(a + c) + b;`
5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.
  > A real world example of a conditional statement would be when deciding if you need to wear a sweater or not. See example of code below:
  > `if (temperature > 70) {`
  > `return wearSweater = true;`
  > `} else {`
  > `return wearSweater = false;`
  > `}`
  > `\\For this example, the person would wear a sweater if the temperature is greater than 70.`
6. Give an example of when a `Loop` is useful in JavaScript.
  > A `loop` is useful when you want to run a code over and over until a condition is met. See example of code below:
  > `let i=1`
  > `for (i=0; i<3; i++) {`
  > `console.log(i)`
  > `}`
  > `\\this loop will run 3 times (i.e when i=0, i=1, and i=3)`
