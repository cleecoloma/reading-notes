# Class 10 Summary
## Code 201 - Foundations of Software Development

>  These topics relates because understanding how to troubleshoot our code to be able to fix errors.

### What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.
1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
  > * Syntax errors are spelling errors in the code the prevents it from running at a specific part of the code or not run at all. These errors are easier to fix than logic errors.
  > * Logic errors happens when the syntax are correct but the code is not what it is intended to be. It normally runs but give incorrect results. These errors are harder to fix than syntax errors.
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
  > * I have encountered both syntax and logic errors. I was able to correct them by using console.log throughout the code and sometimes using the Chrome debugger.
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
  > * This topic will influence my long term goal by understanding that these errors can happen to everyone and I need to utilize the tools that I learned from this class to properly address them in the future.

### The JavaScript Debugger.
1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
  > JavaScript Debugger tool is a step by step tool that allows you to visually check the your code while its running.
2. Define what a breakpoint is.
  > Breakpoint is telling Javascript to pause at a specific line. It's like a stop sign for a car but for your code.
3. What is the call stack?
  > Call stack is a way to track what section of the code is getting executed and helps debug the code by tracking the sequence where an error likely occurred.

### Things I want to learn more about.
1. I know there a JavaScript try catch statement where it lets you proceed with the remainder of the code even if there's an error inside it.
