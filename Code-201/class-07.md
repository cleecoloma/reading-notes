> These topics

### Domain Modeling
1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
  > We need domain modeling because it can clarify the requirements and the design intent. Thus, it can easily be used to communicate between the technical and business teams.

### HTML Table Basics
1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
  > The main reasons why table should not be used for page layouts because of the following:
  > 1. Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users.
  > 2. Tables produce tag soup.
  > 3. Tables are not automatically responsive.
2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.
  > 1. Table header `<th>` - This element allows the table to be more accessible by associating each header with the data in the same row or column.
  > 2. Table row `<tr>` - This element defines a row of cells in a table.
  > 3. Table cell `<td>` - This element definces a cell of a table that contains data.

### Introducing Constructors
1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
  > * A constructor is special function that creates and initializes a object instance of a class.
  > * Advantages - create more than one object from a single definition and changes can be made to the created object without affecting the other instances.
2. How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

### Object Prototypes Using A Constructor
1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
  * NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question.
