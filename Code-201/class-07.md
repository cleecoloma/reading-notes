> These topics

### Domain Modeling
1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
  > We need domain modeling because it can clarify the requirements and the design intent. Thus, it can easily be used to communicate between the technical and business teams.

### HTML Table Basics
1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
  > The main reasons why table should not be used for page layouts because of the following:
  > 1. Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users.
  > 2. Tables produce tag soup.
  > 3. Tables are not automatically responsive.
2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.
  > 1. Table header `<th>` - This element allows the table to be more accessible by associating each header with the data in the same row or column.
  > 2. Table row `<tr>` - This element defines a row of cells in a table.
  > 3. Table cell `<td>` - This element defines a cell of a table that contains data.

### Introducing Constructors
1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
  > * A constructor is special function that creates and initializes a object instance of a class.
  > * Advantages - create more than one object from a single definition and changes can be made to the created object without affecting the other instances.
2. How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
  > The term `this` used in an object literal refers to the object that is being defined while `this` used in a constructor refers to the specific instance of the object that is being created.

### Object Prototypes Using A Constructor
1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
  * NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question.
  > For my mechanical engineering job, I support repair of multiple different types of ships (e.g. 688, 726, and 21 class submarines). Prototypes would be specifications and manual written to repair these different types of ships. Inheritance would be the components that are similar in these ships. For example, a valve in a 688 class submarine could be the same valve in a 726 class submarine.
