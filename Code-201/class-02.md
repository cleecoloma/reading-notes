> These topics relates because they are the basic foundations of software development.

### HTML Text Fundamentals
1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?
  > It is important to use semantic elements in our HTML because it helps the search engine and other use devices to determine the importance and context of a web page. It makes web pages more readable, accessible, and improves its ranking on search engines.

2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?
  > We should avoid using inline styles because they clutter up the HTML and, as a result, making it difficult to read and debug it.
3. Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:

    > h2
  > 2. Which components are the CSS declarations?
    > The components inside a CSS declarations are property and a value.
  > 3. Which components are considered properties?
    > For the example below, the properties are color and padding.

    color: black;
    padding: 5px;
  }`

### Learn JS
1. What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?
  > string
2. List 4 types of JavaScript operators.
  > * Assignment
  > * Comparison
  > * Arithmetic
  > * Logical
3. Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.
  > A calculator. You can make a calculator using functions.

### Making Decisions In Your Code - Conditionals.
1. An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.
  > condition and true
2. What is the use of an `else if`?
  > We use an `else if` if there are more than 2 choices/outcomes.

4. What is the difference between the logical operator `&&` and `||`?
  > * `&&` means and
  > * `||` means or

### Things I want to know more about
1. Using logical operators inside functions
2. Actual use of git branches in a group project
