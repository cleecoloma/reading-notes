# Class 04 Summary
## Code 201 - Foundations of Software Development

> These topics relates because HTML links, JS functions, and CSS layout are essential to great responsive and functional web applications

### Creating Hyperlinks
1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
  > We wrap a text  or other content using a `<a>` element.
2. The `href` attribute contains what information?
  > It contains a corresponding target location usually a link
3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
  > * Avoid jumping around from link to link
  > * Utilize keywords in link text to describe what is being linked to

### CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning
1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
  > Normal flow means how the webpage elements are normally laid out prior to any CSS elements.
2. What are a few differences between `block-level` and `inline` elements?
  > * `Block-level` elements fills up the space of the parent element containing it while `inline` elements is only the size of the content.
3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
  > Static
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

  > * It is great for popup windows.
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
  > Fixed positioning is tied to the visible portion of the viewport.

### Functions - Reusable Block of Code
1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
  > * Parameter is a variable listed during function declaration.
  > * Argument is value passed in place of the parameter during function invocation.

### Pair Programming
1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
  > 1. Engaged collaboration - I picked this because I know that software development is a very collaborative career. Thus, pair programming will help me understand how to work in a team environment.
  > 2. Job interview readiness - I picked this because I learned from watching YouTube coding interviews that it is a very collaborative process between the interviewer and interviewee similar to what can happen during an actual work setting.

### Things I want to know more about
> * I want to know more about how AI will transform the programming industry if it its possible to use it as a pair programming buddy.
