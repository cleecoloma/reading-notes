# Class 07 Summary
## Code 102 - Intro to Software Development
## Programming with JavaScript
> Here's a brief summary in a question and answer layout of what I learned during class 07.

1. What is control flow?
* The order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
2. What is a JavaScript function?
* A block of code designed to perform a particular task.
* A way to make code reusable.
3. Whats does it mean to invoke or call a function?
* Invoking or calling a function is to execute the function with the required parameters.
* This happens when an event occurs (e.g. when a user clicks a button), when it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code, and/or automatically (e.g. self invoked)
4. What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?
* The () operator invokes/calls the function. Inside this operator, there are parameters/arguments received by the function when it is invoked.

> Additional Notes
1. Use typeof to figure out what data types are required for function arguments.
2. Return is placed at the end of the function.
