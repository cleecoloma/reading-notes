# Intro to SQL
## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development in Full-Stack JavaScript

> On Code 301, we learned about MongoDB which is a NoSQL database. It did not use the tabular structure like SQL database. In this assignment, I learned about SQL database by working on SQL Bolt tutorials. It gave me an insight on how to manipulate and manage the outputs based on queries. I like NoSQL database better because it is more flexible especially when I don't know the structure of my database.
