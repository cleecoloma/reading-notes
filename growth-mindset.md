## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development in Full-Stack JavaScript

> These topics relates because part of this software development career is self improvement. A better understanding on my emotional intelligence and bias will create a better version of myself.

### Emotional Intelligence
> After doing the Emotional Intelligence Self-Asssessment Tool, I learned that I need to work on all four categories. The highest score I got was 16 which was social awareness. The lowest score was 14 which was relationship management. I believe the emotion part of the assessment tool had a very big part of the scores I got. I hope to increase my score throughout the course by working on being more aware with myself and manage my emotions while working with others.

### Bias Self-Assessment
> Areas of strengths
>  1. Bias and Identity
>  2. Meaningful Connections
>  3. Connect to Mitigate Bias
>  4. Effective Courage
> Areas of weakness
>  1. Bias and the Brain
>  2. Empathy and Curiosity
>  3. Four Wars to Act
> Based on this, I learned that my best strength is that I'm a team oriented person where being inclusive can result in higher performance in achieving the team goal. On the other hand, I need to work on my self awareness in regards to keeping my gut feelings and emotions while making important decisions. I plan to do this by taking a step back, think about possible outcomes, and take advise from others if possible.
