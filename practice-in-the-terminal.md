# Practice in the Terminal
## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development in Full-Stack JavaScript

> When I started my first Code Fellows class - Code 102, I learned about the terminal. Even though I had some knowledge about it from my self study days, it was on Code 102 that I learned how to properly use it during my coding work. Since then, it was an important part of my daily class life through Code 201 and 301. Reading the tutorials for this assignment, the most helpful thing I learned was the Cheat Sheet. I bookmarked it and it will be readily available for me to look over if there are days when I forget the "syntax" for a terminal command.
